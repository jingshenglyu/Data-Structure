# Chapter 3 Algorithms Analyse

## 3.1 Why algorithms analyse?

Using the different algorithms we can get a good algorithm or a bad algorithm. But the bad algorithms cost too lang time, such as many years. We don't use it.

## 3.2 Using "O" to describe time
We use "O" to describe "Time complexity".
####    3.2.1 O(Assignment Statement) = 1
####    3.2.2 O(Iteration(n) Statement) = n  

## 3.3 Affect
"Time complexity is the standard for how to judge an algorithm.

## 3.4 How to calculate "execution time"
Code 2.1: algorithms with VS without iteration
Code 2.2: Compare 4 algorithms about anagram
Code 2.3: Time Complexity for list() and dict()
