# Chapter 3 Algorithmus Analyse

## 3.1 Why algorithmus analyse?

Using the different algorithmus we can get the good algorithmus or the bad algorithmus. But the bad algorithmus costes too lang time, such as many years. We don't use it.

## 3.2 Using "O" to describe time
We use "O" to describe "Time complexity".
####    3.2.1 O(Assignment Statement) = 1
####    3.2.2 O(Iteration(n) Statement) = n
